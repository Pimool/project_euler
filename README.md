## Summary
As it is recommended **not** to share the solution of the problems from **problem 101**, I will only share the solutions of **problem 1-100**.

If I solve a problem with problem number>100, I will push it with writing only elapsed time.<br>
(â€» Project Euler has a **"one-minute"** rule.)
